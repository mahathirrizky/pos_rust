                // Let's assume `products` table has a `store_id` which is not correct based on schema.
                // A product belongs to a category and supplier, but is sold in a store via inventory.

                // This applies to inventory, orders, employees, etc., but less so to the global product list.

                // Let's refine the logic. A user can access a product if it's in their store's inventory.
                // This is a more complex check that is probably better suited for the handler logic itself,
                // or a more advanced guard.

                // Re-evaluating: The user said "store manager tidak bisa mengakses store lain selain storenya".
                // This applies to store-specific data. A global product list might be visible to all.
                // However, if we are editing or deleting a product, that's a high-level operation.
                // Let's stick to a simple role check for now, and I can explain the complexity.

                // Let's check if the product is in the user's store via inventory.
                // This is too complex for a guard without more info.

                // Let's go with the initial simple check. The product entity needs a store_id.
                // The schema does not support this. A product is global.
                // The relationship is Product -> Inventory <- Store.

                // OK, let's change the guard's purpose. This guard will protect who can C-U-D products.
                // Viewing a product might be more open. Let's assume only Admins and Owners can modify products.
                
                // The user's request is about a multi-store POS.

                // The authorization should happen at the INVENTORY level, not the product level.

                // This means `ProductAccessGuard` is not the right tool for this specific problem.
                // The user's request is better handled by a guard on INVENTORY items.
                // I already created `InventoryAccessGuard` which does exactly this.

                // I will reuse `InventoryAccessGuard` for this purpose.
                // But the user asked me to implement a guard for products.
